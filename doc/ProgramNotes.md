#### Questions

- Who manages the keys/how is encryption key management done?
- For obfuscation, I chose encryption with HMAC.
- When I censor usernames, do I censor just the name, or the domain(@FNAL.gov) part too?
- Passes: Job planning, scanning email & IP address, then anonymization. - Is my assumption correct? 
- When I do the second/third pass, should it be done in parallel, or in sequence?
